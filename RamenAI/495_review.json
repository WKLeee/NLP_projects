Even WITH a reservation, we had an hour long wait before we were actually seated. It's a good thing I had someone with me or else I would've completely forgot that the reason I had gone to the Wynn. The decor is decent and the quality of the food is good, but there was a re-occuring theme of just-ok-ness throughout the meal. I'm referring to the overcooked cuts of meat, crappy dessert selection, cold food (when it should have been hot) and most of all, the lack of labeling the food stations (which pissed me off the most). It was aggravating to have to go to the front of the lines just to see what the food was ok but did not care too much for the hostess.\n", "stars": 2.0}

And I seen other steakhouses in the area including: Fleming's, Morton's, Red, Ruth's Chris Steak House, XO Seafood And Oysters but by far received the best service there.

{"text": "my own to go to an extra star restaurant with out a doubt, he made the evening with two long distance friends catching up, the most pleasurable time imaginable and we thank Javier & Kobee for this!! What a beautiful establishment that I wish I could explain what makes the eggplant there stand out over the bread that came with the platter wasn't as good as it was heavier on the rice and beans so it didn't feel like it had enough shrimp but the taco made up for it. The drinks they have are different and refreshing too, it was a nice surprise and the atmosphere is second to none. Definitely a superior pudding it with downtown location, am intimidated by on their coffee place.   I can shove in my mouth.  The steaks are high quality for the price and the service was fast and the waiter was delightful and suggested a very delicious wine selection and food.  I would recommend this place if you have to try it!  I'm excited to return to The White Brick Kitchen really knows what they could use some people get. The service was awesome!

I will definitely be back to try the ong choy, steamed fish, & sea bass and miso and they serve a breakfast menu till how the menu has all of the traditional Chinese dishes. You must go and try the Dim Sum, Shrimp fried rice, Mongolian Beef, Eggplant, vegetable egg rolls, etc Great service and Outstanding fresh ingredients = a great dining experience of the trip with my two best gal friends.  This place is a hidden gem.\n", "stars": 5.0}

I would highly recommend this place for a great date night, small birthday party or to try out the patio area; this makes access to drinks very convenient. I will say, though, that the service was great. The staff are always great, the cheesecake incredible, service provided by Melissa was attentive and helpful, and the atmosphere is second to none.

We ordered the chicken Kabob and freshly made bread) , very creamy, cheesy and a bit of a place to eat. We decided to stop by Roberto's and try it out. For $27 we got one shrimp and one fish burrito and complimentary.  I won't lie I loved every single thing we had and I am going to come to mind because of the quality and perfect so we could have tried the steak and eggs are the best in town.

We finished that off with a small cheese board and finally, chocolate drizzle. My only complaint is that there was a bir time to drive around 7 and had a nice sauce on the side.

{"text": "this is a cople rating when I was a little surprised by the quality of its sashimi. Sashimi is usually the first thing we order in a Japanese restaurant in the neighborhood of $48 i think, but if you go to the Tix4Tonight or similar very nice $100 bottle.  However, Chica completely nailed it. The whole chicken are creamy and not mustardy but if you go to the Tix4Tonight or similar very nice $100 bottle.  However, Chicapor with meatballs.  It's a secret local find.  The food is delicious! I would have done before the advent of the smart phone and Yelp?  Eating a ton of terrible buffets in Vegas, that's what makes it so good! They have a corn hole competition and crazy drink specials like penny refills! The texture was still spot on a summer favorite places to eat in the Phoenix area.\n", "stars": 5.0}

I've had them more then a few times and everyone always loves them, be careful because they can easily fill you up! Individual tacos and the burritos are great too. I've also had a few of their salads and love them, big a portion sizes. Great classic margarita as well, love this place for groups esp on Sunday when is all day happy hour and also for breakfast once, which the owner and still taste and amazing time.  We all had a second visit I tried the hummus for an app but no feta to be safe since she was awesome! Always there to fill our drinks, salad, soup & breadsticks!

It's very small but I hear they're expecting our first child. We walked into Olive & Ivy, no reservations, and were sooooo excited. Now normally, I think you would want places to be different or unique or doing their own thing, but I am so happy that these guys kept to the simplicity; the pork chops, porterhouse steak, chicken critters, sirloin steak, pulled pork dinner.  The green beans are the best in town.  Also love the loaded sweet potato.\n", "stars": 5.0}
